      <h2 class="title"><b>Destiny 2 Lightfall Release Time</b></h2>

        <p>  Destiny 2's new Lightfall expansion gets an official release date and time. Bungie's free-to-play online shooter will introduce its latest expansion, which will add a new location, campaign, and raid. With Destiny 2: Lightfall, players will also be able to enjoy fresh quests, loot, and Strand subclasses. </p>
        <p> Previously, Destiny 2: Lightfall was accidentally released earlier than the intended date in some regions, which caused a severe bug preventing players from logging in. While a fix was facilitated by Bungie, many fans were left excited with the screens brought about by the latest update. Destiny 2: Lightfall will seemingly take on a darker tone than usual, and will tap into a unique vaporware visual style, which gives out a nice change of pace. However, the expansion now has an official release date and time, which will allow gamers to finally experience the new features. </p>

            <h3 class="title">Best 5-Star Weapon Substitutes</h3>
            <div class="img"><img src="images/g1.jpg" width="200"></div>
            <p>
                According to <i>GameWith</i>, the best substitute weapon for Dehya's Beacon of the Reed Sea is the 5-star claymore Redhorn Stonethresher. For reference, this is Arataki Itto's signature weapon in Genshin Impact. The claymore has the lowest base attack (542 at level 90) of all 5-star weapons in that category but compensates for it with a whopping CRIT DMG sub-stat (88.2% at level). This allows players to focus primarily on CRIT Rate, HP, and Pyro DMG when building Dehya.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Best 4-Star Weapon Substitutes</h3>
            <div class="img1"><img src="images/g2.jpg" width="200"></div>
            <p>
                There are a few interesting 4-star weapon substitutes for Dehya in Genshin Impact. The first is Serpent Spine. This Battle Pass-locked claymore has a medium-ranged base attack (510 at level 90), with a decent CRIT Rate sub-stat (27.6% at level 90). This weapon also gradually increases the user's DMG by 6% every 4 seconds they are on the field. However, the user also takes 3% more DMG every 4 seconds, which makes it a risky choice if players do not have any good healers in Genshin Impact to mitigate the extra damage.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Best F2P Weapon Substitutes</h3>
            <div class="img"><img src="images/g3.jpg" width="200"></div>
            <p>
                For F2P players, there are still a few weapon substitute options for Dehya in Genshin Impact. The first one of them is the craftable Prototype Archaic. This is the go-to claymore for F2P players who want to increase a character's damage output.This forgeable weapon also has a decent base attack (565 at level 90), and its ATK sub-stat (27.6% at level 90) goes along well with Dehya's scaling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second F2P weapon substitute for Dehya is Blackcliff Slasher. This claymore is significantly more difficult to obtain since it requires the use of Genshin Impact's Masterless Starglitter in Paimon's Bargains.Blackcliff Slasher has a low base attack (510 at level 90), but a high CRIT DMG sub-stat (55.1% at level 90). The weapon skill, Press the Advantage, increases the user's ATK by 12% for 30 seconds after defeating an opponent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third one is Luxurious Sea-Lord. This weapon's great ATK sub-stat (55.1% at level 90) compensates for its very low base attack (454 at level 90) and its weapon skill, Oceanic Victory, is amazing for Dehya's Elemental Burst in Genshin Impact. The skill boosts Elemental Burst DMG by 12% and, whenever the ability hits an opponent, there is a 100% chance of summoning a tuna that deals 100% of the character's ATK as AoE DMG. This is well in line with Dehya's ATK scaling, making it a strong candidate for weapon substitute in Genshin Impact.

        <h2 class="title"><a href="#"><i>Hogwarts Legacy: Solved By The Bell Quest Guide</i></a></h2>
        <div class="story">
          <p>  Players will come across the Musical Map in Henrietta's Hideaway, a key location for Hogwarts Legacy's The Hippogriff Marks The Spot side quest and Rescuing Rococo. The Hippogriff Marks The Spot also involves following a map to buried treasure, and players can start that quest by finding Henrietta's Map at a small Bandit Camp along the Poidsear Coast.</p>
            <div class="img2"><img src="images/hl.jpg" width="400"></div>
            <p>Henrietta's Hideaway can be found at the location marked on the map above. Players will need to fight through several Ashwinders, using Hogwarts Legacy's best spell combos to gain the upper hand. On top of that, there's an Elemental Cube Puzzle and magical floors that can prevent players from entering certain areas unless they're tricked.</p>
           <fieldset>
            <legend><b>Tip </b></legend>
            <table>
                <p>The easiest way to get past these floor traps is to use Arresto Momentum or to drop objects on them with Wingardium Leviosa before running through them.</p>
            </table>
           </fieldset> <br>
           <p>The Musical Map that starts Solved By The Bell is found in the same secret room as one of the elemental cubes used in the final puzzle in Henrietta's Hideaway. The map can be found on a table to the left of the entrance.The Musical Map points to Clagmar Castle, which can be found in the Clagmar Coast region along with several of Hogwarts Legacy's Southern Regions Merlin Trials. After clearing out the Ashwinders, players should make their way over to the western part of the ruins, where they should be able to spot nine large bells hanging up in the air.</p>
           <div class="img2"><img src="images/hl1.jpg" width="400"></div>
           <p>To solve the puzzle, players must hit the bells with Basic Cast in order to play the special tune printed on the Musical Map. Players unfamiliar with musical notation can just hit the bells in the order shown above to play the right tune. Much like Hogwarts Legacy's Chess Puzzle, the melody is an Easter egg, and fans will immediately recognize it as the iconic theme from the Harry Potter movies.</p>
           <p>Playing the theme will cause a chest to appear magically. Looting it completes Hogwarts Legacy's Solved By The Bell quest and grants players some treasure, Galleons, and XP.</p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="#"><i>How To Beat The Builder In Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</i></a></h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>To beat The Builder, players will need to battle him in two phases. First, it is important that players pick up on The Builder's movements and take advantage of the visual queues when they show up. Players are recommended to have a minimum power level of 90 to defeat the Builder. The visual queues will be visible once he lifts his arms for an attack. Eivor should clear the vicinity as soon as possible to avoid being hit with a deadly attack. This tough boss fight unfolds in two phases where the Builder gets more aggressive in the second phase. Players are recommended to equip Eivor with AC Valhalla's best weapons and weapons for this fight.</p>
            <div class="img2"><img src="images/ac.jpg" width="400"></div>
            <h3 class="title">Phase One</h3>
            <p>The easiest way to damage this boss in Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is to avoid his attacks until he propels Eivor into the air. This is because the Builder's weak point happens to be his head, and being in the air gives Eivor a chance to take shots with a powerful bow like the Nodens' Arc.Once the Builder is stunned, players can damage the Builder with their best weapon at hand and repeat the process until this phase is over.</p>
            <h3 class="title">Phase Two</h3>
            <p>Once players deplete the Builder's health by hand, he will try to encompass Eivor in a force field. Players must dodge and sprint to avoid being trapped in this force field. While avoiding this force field, some air launches will be scattered in the area, which Eivor can use to propel into the air.</p>
             <p>In this phase, players will need to repeat this action as much as possible to get a clear shot of the Builder's head. Players must repeat this process until the Builder gets stunned, after which Eivor can use a powerful melee weapon like the Sepulcher Fire Axe to bring him down.</p>
            <p>Once The Builder has been defeated, Eivor will need to make their way to the door to Jotunheim in Assassin's Creed Valhalla and will wake up in Midgard under the watchful eye of Valka. Gather the necessary ingredients for Valka to make another potion to slip back into Asgard.</p>

        <h2 class="title"><a href="#"><i>Where To Find Lightstone & Mirrorstone In Wild Hearts</i></a></h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>The easiest way to find either Mirrorstone or Lightstone would be to mine certain rock collections within areas of the map. Glowing rock formations give players a prompt to mine for resources, usually yielding at least one of the two materials needed for weapon upgrades. Incredibly commonplace around regions where players can beat bosses like Spineglider in Wild Hearts, the core of these rock groups have a different color that indicates which material it gives.</p>
            <p>Lightstones are found in rocks with an amber-orange hue, while Mirrorstones can be discovered in formations with a yellow crystal in their center. While enough exploration around cliffs, rock faces, and other collections of stone inevitably gives players Mirrorstone and Lightstone, there are other methods to finding either material.</p>
            <div class="img2"><img src="images/wh.jpg" width="400"></div>
            <fieldset>
                <legend><b>Tip </b></legend>
                <table>
                    <p>Players can also build a Tsukumo Ore Shrine that collects ores automatically that is capable of gathering 5 resources at a time. Players can quickly go to their camp once they unlock fast travel to grab the items from their shrine in between adventures.</p>
                </table>
               </fieldset> <br>
               <p>The best places to build a Tsukumo Ore Shrine to collect Mirrorstone and Lightstone are where players first find the ores. For example, constructing an Ore Shrine in Fuyufusagi Fort likely leads to free collections of Lightstone, while a Shrine built in a camp near Akikure Canyon has a high chance of producing Mirrorstone. Even though players can find Mirrorstone and Lightstone on their own in the regions of Wild Hearts, the extra resources collected from these Shrines eases the amount of time it might take to find enough of either item to upgrade a weapon.</p>
